Item upgrades
- Items level 1, 2, 3.
- Start at one, level to 3.
- Pack-a-punch like mechanics. Upgrades are ridiculous
(not sure if you need to find a shrine to upgrade weapons or something)
(not sure if it will cost exp or if there will be a currency [upgrade stones?])

Ally/Enemy bonuses
- Once you beat a boss's encounter, you will get an ally bonus (+exp, +move speed, soemthing like that)
or an enemy bonus if the boss is evil. 
- Doesn't change progression of the game, 
- Shit talking an evil boss makes him/her hate you.
- Helping a friendly boss will make him/her like you.
- Forces player to decide whether or not someone is good or evil and interact with them in that way.
