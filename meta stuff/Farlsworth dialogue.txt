Throughout this whole adventure you've been asked questions.
You've made decisions.
Every time you made a choice.
Sometimes you were given a choice between two extremes.
Sometimes you chose one extreme, sometimes you chose the other.
There's got to be one time you didn't agree with either?
They're extremes, after all.
WHY did you choose?
You didn't agree with both of them.
And yet you still made a choice.
Because you felt you had to.
But I understand the world. I COMPLETELY understand.
Sometimes, you don't have to make a choice.
Sometimes, no choice is the right choice.
Sometimes, you can choose NOT to choose.
A person of high virtue, they wouldn't choose.
You always have the right to abstain from making a choice.
But unfortunately, the very nature of the universe is corrupt.
There will always be an ongoing battle between extremes.
There will never be rest. 
There will only be pain and destruction for those in the middle.
And we're all in the middle.
There are no true extremes.
We're all destined to a life of pain and suffering.
And you know what's better than a life of pain?
Nothing at all.

For the first time in your adventure...
I'm going to kill you for the first time.
Except you won't come back.
You'll never come back.
And I'll succeed anyway. 
Why not take one final pleasure in watching me take away all of the world's pain?
